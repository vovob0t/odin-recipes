# odin-recipes

Thats a wrap up for a part of foundations course on "The Odin Project"

I will only use the HTML and we'll try to make a recipe site
with something interesting to show!

## Course impressions

So far liking all of it! And it's finally time to code after Linux learning and HTML basics.
I'm excited!!!
